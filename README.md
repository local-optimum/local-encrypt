# Local Encrypt

Welcome to **Local Encrypt**—a sleek, browser-based tool to securely encrypt and decrypt any file right on your device. No servers, no uploads, just pure, private encryption with AES-256-GCM. Plus, it restores your filetypes on decryption, so you’re back in action without the guesswork.

## Why Use It?
- **Privacy First**: Everything happens locally—your files never leave your machine.
- **Strong Security**: Powered by AES-256-GCM and PBKDF2 with 1M iterations.
- **User-Friendly**: Drag, drop, encrypt, done. Clean design inspired by X.com’s aesthetic.
- **Tip Me**: Loved it? Send some Sol to `localoptimum.sol`!

## How It Works
1. Drop a file or click to upload.
2. Enter a key (16+ characters) or generate one.
3. Hit "Encrypt" to secure your file, or "Decrypt" to unlock it.
4. Download your result—filetypes preserved!
